Update coming soon!

Punch is a server-based timer. A digital punch clock, if you will. It's PHP/mySQL backend ensure you never lose your timings in case of a crash or accidental closing of your browser.

This script is by no means perfect and not even close to elegant. I like to put in the "Hey, it works!" category.

== FEATURES ==
* It works.
* Pause/continue.
* Time notation: start time / stop time / elapsed time / decimal time.
* As it's server based, the browser window doesn't need to be open for the timer to run.

== INSTALLATION ==
1. Fire up phpMyAdmin (or whatever client you use), create/enter a database and create the following table in it:

	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `prikklok` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `start` datetime default NULL,
	  `punch_in` datetime default NULL,
	  `punch_out` datetime default NULL,
	  `end` datetime default NULL,
	  `status` tinyint(1) default NULL,
	  `elapsed` int(11) default NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;

2. Open index.php and supply the database credentials on top.

3. Open a browser and go to wherever your script resides.
